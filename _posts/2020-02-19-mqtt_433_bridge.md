I have some of the [Zap/Etekcity remote outlets](https://www.etekcity.com/product/100068).
One outlet is used to control the overhead lights in the front room.
Another outlet controls a lamp by my chair in the same room.
Other outlets are used at various times and circumstances, for instance, to control the Christmas tree lights.

I thought it would be useful/fun to control these outlets through Home Assistant or other wifi enabled devices.
I found a project called [OpenMQTTGateway](https://github.com/1technophile/OpenMQTTGateway) by [1technophile](https://1technophile.blogspot.com/).
This seems like the exact project I need for my application. Thanks 1technophile!

The first thing I needed to do was to find out what codes my Zap remote generated.
And, of course, I go down a rabbit hole post haste.
There was a sticker on my remote and on the outlet that said "315".
So I figured the devices were using 315MHz.
I used rtl_433 to search for the signal in the 315 MHz range but couldn't find it.
Finally, I read the fine print on one of the outlets and saw that it uses 433.92 MHz.
I found that my remote produces the following codes:  

| button | ON | OFF |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | 21811 | 21820 |
| 2 | 21955 | 21964 |
| 3 | 22275 | 22284 |
| 4 | 23811 | 23820 |
| 5 | 29955 | 29964 |
