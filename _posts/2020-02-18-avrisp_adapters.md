## AVR Programming Adapters

I've used a lot of different AVR programmers in the past including some home made ones:  
* PC parallel port (with & without 74xx244)
* PC parallel port (with 74xx125)
* PC serial port (with 74xx126)
* PC serial port with transistors & zeners
* USBtiny using ATtiny2313 and V-USB

I used perf board and point-to-point wiring on all those I made. Now that I need glasses, it is not as easy to build stuff.

I purchased a few different ISP programmers, too:  
* AVR Butterfly
* Atmel STK500
* Bus Pirate
* Sparkfun AVR programmer

Currently, I use the AVR USB ISP Version 2.0 programmers purchased from ![Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33058820632.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.7f7162baWPHDPv&algo_pvid=1870d67e-d175-4b41-84f5-6b9bed5020b9&algo_expid=1870d67e-d175-4b41-84f5-6b9bed5020b9-3&btsid=0ab50f6115820953717403273e475a&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_). But this blog entry is mainly to dicument several of the programmer adapters/cables I've built.
